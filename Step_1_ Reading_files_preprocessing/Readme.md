ASSIGNMENT 1 :- Execution details

As the files exceeded more than 25MB, I have only placed the .py files in GitHub. The MSCI_641_Assignement_1.py file contains all the execution and the main.py is the file to be executed which has the driver of MSCI_641_Assignement_1.py. Kindly execute main.py. The main.py expects one argument to be passed from command line which is the path to the folder (The folder should contain files named as pos.txt and neg.txt). Hence kindly specify only the path to the folder in command line and not the name of the files (for eg:- kindly enter "c:\\users\\raw_data" and please don't specify the name of the file like "c:\\users\\raw_data\\pos.txt") .
